**Project Overview:** BlinkIt Sales and Performance Dashboard

# Project Goal
The primary objective of this Power BI dashboard is to provide a comprehensive, interactive view of BlinkIt's sales and operational performance across various dimensions, including item type, fat content, outlet location, size, and establishment year. The dashboard aims to enable data-driven decision-making by identifying key sales drivers, top-performing categories, and areas for potential optimization.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard provides an immediate overview of the platform's performance:

**Total Sales**:	1 Million (1M)
**Total Items**:	9 Thousand (9K)
**Average Sales**:	141
**Average Rating**:	3.92

# Item Volume and Content Analysis

The dashboard indicates a total of 9K items currently tracked.

# 1. By Item Fat Content (Donut Chart)

Low Fat items significantly outweigh Regular items in volume, making up 6K of the total items compared to 3K for Regular items.

# 2. By Item Type (Bar Chart)

Fruits and Vegetables (1232 items) and Snack Foods (1200 items) are the most numerous item categories.

Household (910 items) and Frozen Foods (856 items) are the next largest categories by item count.

Seafood (64 items) and Breakfast (110 items) are the least represented categories.

# 3. Item Fat Content by Location Tier (Stacked Bar)

Low Fat items dominate the count in all three tiers, with the highest volume in Tier 3 (2.2K Low Fat) and the lowest in Tier 1 (1.5K Low Fat).

#  Outlet Volume and Performance Analysis

# 1. Outlet Type Performance (Table)

While all outlet types maintain nearly identical Average Sales ($140 - $142) and Average Ratings (3.9), the volume and sales distribution are highly skewed:
Outlet Type	Total Sales	

Supermarket Type 1	$7,87,550	5,577	The dominant outlet, responsible for the vast majority of sales and item volume.

Grocery Store	$1,51,939	1,083	Second highest in both sales and item volume.

# 2. Outlet Volume by Size (Pie Chart)

Medium-sized outlets stock the highest volume of items (approx. 4K).

Small outlets hold the second-highest volume (approx. 3K).

High outlets hold the lowest volume (approx. 2K).

# 3. Outlet Volume by Location Tier (Bar Chart)

Tier 3 and Tier 2 locations both stock the highest volume of items at 3K each.

Tier 1 locations stock the lowest volume at 2K.

# 4. Outlet Establishment Year (Line Chart - Total Items)

The number of items established/introduced peaked dramatically around 2018 (1463 items), with other years generally seeing a stable volume of around 920-930 items.

# Conclusion
The BlinkIt platform is heavily driven by Supermarket Type 1 outlets, which stock the largest volume of items (5.5K out of 9K) and generate the most revenue. The inventory focus is clearly on Low Fat items, especially in the Fruits/Vegetables and Snack Foods categories, with Medium outlets and Tier 3/Tier 2 locations being the primary volume hubs
